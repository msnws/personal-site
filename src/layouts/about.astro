        <p>
            I’m a front-end developer and designer who blends aesthetic
            sensibility with functional precision. With an eight-year background
            in graphic design, I create interfaces that look beautiful, feel
            intuitive, and perform seamlessly across devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m currently honing my development skills and looking for
            opportunities where I can contribute to both design and
            implementation. My ideal role sits at the intersection of creativity
            and code—building user experiences that are as elegant as they are
            effective.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Astro, and well-versed
            in generative AI tools both as a user and developer. In my free
            time, I’m likely exploring the Chicago Art Institute, playing video
            games, or attempting to make the perfect pour-over coffee at home.
