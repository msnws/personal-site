            I’m Mason Weis — a front-end developer and designer who blends
            technical skill with a strong background in branding, visual
            communication, and user-centered design. After nearly a decade as a
            senior graphic designer, I shifted into development to build digital
            experiences that are not only beautiful but highly functional. With
            expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive web design, I
            create clean, engaging sites that help brands tell their story
            effectively online.
